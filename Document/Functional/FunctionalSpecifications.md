# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Purpose of the document
This document defines the functional specifications of the Quickest Path project, which aims to develop a high-performance software solution in C++ that calculates the fastest path between two landmarks in the USA. The system will expose its functionality via a REST API supporting JSON and XML response formats. The main aim is to deliver fast, accurate results within the constraints specified by the client.
