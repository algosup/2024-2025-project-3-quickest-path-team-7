### **Weekly Report - Week 2**  

#### **Overview**  
The second week saw significant progress in learning C++ and the initial stages of algorithm development. Team members also started working on technical and functional specifications.  

#### **Accomplishments**  
- **Deeper C++ Learning** – The team worked on bitwise operations and technical aspects.  
- **Drafting Documentation** – Initial versions of **Functional** and **Technical Specifications** were written.  
- **Algorithm Development** – Work began on the shortest path calculation algorithm.  

#### **Challenges**  
- **Algorithm Complexity** – Bitwise operations and optimization presented difficulties.  
- **Documentation** – Writing specifications took longer than expected.  

#### **Plan for Next Week**  
- Finalize the first versions of the **Functional** and **Technical Specifications**.  
- Improve the algorithm for better performance.  
- Begin unit testing for core functionalities.
