### **Weekly Report - Week 3**  

#### **Overview**  
This week saw major progress on the algorithm and technical documentation. The algorithm was functional but needed optimization.  

#### **Accomplishments**  
- **Functional Algorithm** – The shortest path algorithm was implemented but was slow.  
- **Updated Documentation** – The **Functional** and **Technical Specifications** were revised to reflect algorithm changes.  
- **Test Plan Initiation** – QA began writing the **Test Plan** and unit tests.  

#### **Challenges**  
- **Algorithm Performance** – Execution time needed improvement on Windows.  
- **Specification Adjustments** – Changes in the algorithm required significant updates to documents.  

#### **Plan for Next Week**  
- Optimize the algorithm to reduce execution time.  
- Finalize the **Test Plan** and begin unit testing.  
- Prepare a strategy for performance improvements in Week 4.
